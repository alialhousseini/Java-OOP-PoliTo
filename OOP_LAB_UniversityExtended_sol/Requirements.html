<h1 style="text-align: center;">University Management System</h1>

Design and implement a program to manage university courses, teachers, and students.<br>
All the classes must belong to the package <b>university</b>.
<p>

<h2 id="R1">R1. University</h2>
<p>
The user interface (not part of this assignment) interacts through the class <b>University</b>, 
whose constructor accepts as argument the name of the university.
</p><p>
The name of the university can be retrieved through method <b>getName()</b>.<p>
It is possible to assign the name of the Rector by means of the method <b>setRector()</b> 
that accepts as arguments the first and last name of the Rector.
</p><p>
The method <b>getRector()</b> returns the first and last name of the Rector concatenated and 
separated by a blank space (<i>" "</i>). 
</p>


<h2 id="R2" >R2. Students</h2>
<p>
It is possible to enter information concerning a new student thought the method 
<b>enroll()</b> of class <i>University</i>, that accepts as arguments first and last name 
of the student; the method returns the ID number that has been assigned to the student.<br>
ID numbers are are assigned progressively in each university starting from number 10000.
</p><p>
To retrieve the information about a student we can use the method <b>student()</b> 
that accepts as  an argument the ID number and returns a string made up of ID, first, 
and last name separated by blank spaces, e.g. <i>"10000 Donald Duck"</i>.
</p>

<ul class="hint">
<li>We can assume that each university has at most 1000 enrolled students.
</ul>

<h2 id="R3">R3. Courses</h2>
<p>
To define a new course we can use the method <b>activate()</b> that accepts as arguments
the title of the course and the name of the responsible teacher. The method returns an integer
that corresponds to the course code. Course codes are assigned progressively starting from 10.
</p><p>
To retrieve the information about a course we can use the method <b>course()</b> that accepts 
the course's code and returns a string containing code, title, and teacher separated by commas, 
e.g., <i>"10,Object Oriented Programming,James Gosling"</i>.
</p>

<ul class="hint">
<li>We can safely assume that any university offers no more than 50 courses.
</ul>


<h2 id="R4">R4. Course attendance</h2>
<p>
Students that wish to attend a course must be registered through the method <b>register()</b> 
that accepts as arguments the ID of the student and the course's code.
</p><p>
To get the list of students attending a course we can use the method <b>listAttendees()</b> 
that accepts the code of the course and returns a string containing the list of attendees.<br>
The students appear one per row (rows are terminated by a new-line character <i>'\n'</i>) 
and each row is formatted as describe in requirement <a href="#R2">R2</a>.
</p><p>
Given the ID of a student, it is possible to get the  list of courses she is attending
through the method <b>studyPlan()</b>. The courses are described one per row and formatted 
as described in requirement <a href="#R3">R3</a>.
</p>

<ul class="hint">
<li>We can safely assume that no course has more than 100 attendees and that each student 
can attend no more that 25 distinct courses.
</ul>

<h2 id="R5">R5. Exams</h2>
<p>
Students can take the exams for the courses in which they have been enrolled. 
The grade for an exam can be registered through the method <b>exam()</b> that accepts as arguments the ID 
of the student, course code and a grade (integer 0-30).
</p><p>
To get the average grade for a student, the method <b>studentAvg()</b> 
is used. It accepts as argument the ID of the student. If the student took at least one exam 
it returns a String of the following format <i>"Student STUDENT_ID : AVG_GRADE"</i>. 
Otherwise, it  returns <i>"Student STUDENT_ID hasn't taken any exams"</i>.
</p><p>
It is possible to get the average grades of all students that took the exam for a given course, 
method <b>courseAvg()</b> accepting as argument the course code can be used for this purpose. 
The format is the following: <i>"The average for the course COURSE_TITLE is: COURSE_AVG"</i>, 
if at least one student took the exam for that course. 
If this is not the case, the method should return <i>"No student has taken the exam in COURSE_TITLE"</i>.
</p>
<ul class="hint">
<li>It can be safely assumed that if a student takes an exam, 
it has been previously enrolled to the corresponding course.
</ul>

<h2 id="R6">R6. Student award</h2>
<p>
The university has decided to award the best students for their hard-work and effort. 
The method <b>topThreeStudents()</b> is used to retrieve information for helping the
committee to award the price(s).
<p> 
The students' score is evaluated as the average grade of the exams they've taken. 
To take into account the number of exams taken and not only the grades, 
special bonus is assigned on top of the average grade:
the number of taken exams divided by the number of courses the student is enrolled to, 
multiplied by 10 is added. 
<p>
The method returns a string with the information about the three students with the
highest score.
The students appear one per row (rows are terminated by a new-line character <i>'\n'</i>) 
and each one of them is formatted as: <i>"STUDENT_FIRSTNAME STUDENT_LASTNAME : SCORE"</i>.
</p>

<ul class="hint">
<li>Assume that there are no ties.
</ul>


<h2 id="R7">R7. Logger</h2>
<p>
Add logging of operations performed through the <i>UniversityExt</i> facade class. 
Such operations include:
<ul>
<li>enrolling a new student: <i>"New student enrolled: 10000, Mario Rossi"</i><br></li>
<li>activating a new course <i>"New course activated: 11, Object Oriented Programming James Gosling"</i><br></li>
<li>a student signing up for a course <i>"Student 10004 signed up for course 11"</i><br></li>
<li>a student taking an exam <i>"Student 10001 took an exam in course 12 with grade 27"</i><br></li>
</ul>
</p>

<ul class="hint">
<li>to perform logging a <i>logger</i> object of class 
<a href="https://oop.polito.it/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html"><i>java.util.logging.Logger</i></a> 
is available within class <i>UniversityExt</i>;
<li>use the <a href="https://oop.polito.it/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html#info-java.lang.String-"
><i>info()</i> method</a> of object <i>logger</i> to generate the logging messages;
<li>please note that by default the messages will be printed to the console.
